# Parallel-Histogram-Equalization

Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram. 

This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the image is represented by a narrow range of intensity values. Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram utilizing the full range of intensities evenly. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the highly populated intensity values which use to degrade image contrast. 

In this repo you will find a parallel implemntation of Histogram Equalization using the [MPI Library](https://www.open-mpi.org/) and wirtten in C++.
